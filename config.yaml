    content: |-
      I am a Software Engineer with a huge passion for data and analytics, and the Cloud computing ecosystem.
      I truly believe in the DevOps culture and its benefits.
      I cannot imagine a project without CI/CD, automation or monitoring.
      I also have a strong interest in the IoT world and its application in multiple fields.

      I am currently working as a Big Data Engineer at [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com),
      where I have designed, implemented, deployed, monitored and maintained multiple streaming applications
      for processing data in real time in the AWS cloud.
      
      I was honored with the [Final Degree Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krHMfnayADHeWNg5gBrqJwiVuEcmiIC1/view?usp=sharing)
      for the highest GPA of the Software Engineer Degree.

          * Developed and __end-to-end solution__ for __monitoring__ __Flink__ and __EMR__; which includes the collection, processing and loading of Flink/EMR __metrics__ and __logs__; and the creation of __dashboards__ in __Grafana__ and __Kibana__ for their visualization and analysis.
          * __Automated__ the __configuration__ of the __EMR__ clusters through __Ansible__, following a __GitOps__ philosophy.
          * Implemented a __Continuous Delivery__ pipeline for the deployment of __Flink__ jobs in __EMR__, based on the __declarative__ paradigm.
          * Developed a __proof of concept__ of the new __Flink SQL__ version, to __homologate__ it and promote its usage within the project.
          * Improved and __evolved__ a __Java framework__ based on __Flink__, including abstractions over the new __Flink SQL__ API version, which __simplified the development__ of streaming applications focused on the __joins__ between streams of events.
          * __Reduced__ in a __60\%__ the __costs__ of the __AWS infrastructure__, due to the __analysis__ of the __consumptions__ of the __EMR__ and __ElastiCache__ services, and the __optimization__ of the used __instances__ (number and type of instances, as well as the use of __spot__ instances).
          * Kept a __close contact__ with the development teams of the __client__, focused on the decision making and continuous improvement.
          * Made __guards__ focused on the __maintenance__ of the __production__ applications, __solving__ numerous __incidents__.
          * Was __selected__ by __Accenture__ to take part of the __TechStar__ program (in which  __less than 1%__ of the analysts and consultants of Accenture Technology can participate), and in which I was able to __reinforce__ my __technical__, __soft__ and __management skills__.
          * __Interviewed__ __3 people__ to choose a new member for our project __development team__ (technical interviews).
          * __Lead__ a __team of 3 developers__ to carry out and deploy multiple __projects__ developed in __Flink__.
          * __Participated__ in a __RFP__ (Request For Proposals) for one of the largest insurance companies in the market, in which I __designed__ a __serverless microservices architecture__ on __AWS__, with high and low level diagrams, which was a complete __success__, given the fact that __the project was awarded to Accenture__, and we received the __direct greetings from the CDO__ of the insurance company.
