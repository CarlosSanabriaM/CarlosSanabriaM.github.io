    title: "About Me"

    content: |-
      I am a Software Engineer with a strong passion for data and analytics, and the Cloud computing ecosystem.
      I have a solid background in data streaming processing, particularly with Apache Flink, in the AWS cloud.
      I am a strong advocate of the DevOps culture and its benefits, and I cannot imagine a project without CI/CD, automation or monitoring.
      I also have a keen interest in the IoT world and its applications across various fields.

      I have +5 years of experience in the data ecosystem, and I am currently working as a Data Engineer at
      [Openbank](https://www.opendigitalservices.com/) in Spain. I also have some experience in leading
      development teams and teaching online classes.
      
      I was honored with the [Final Degree Award](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1krHMfnayADHeWNg5gBrqJwiVuEcmiIC1/view?usp=sharing)
      for the best academic record in the Software Engineer Degree.

      Iâ€™m a very curious person, always eager to learn new things and improve myself every day.
      I am very disciplined with my habits, and I always try to do my best to achieve my goals.

      As for my hobbies, I really enjoy staying active and practicing sports, especially going to the gym,
      but I am always open to exploring new sports whenever I can. I like spending time with my friends and my girlfriend,
      watching football, listening to music and podcasts, playing video games, and collecting vinyl records and anime statues.
      I am also an avid reader, particularly of personal development books, manga, and video game magazines.
      I love traveling, experiencing diverse cultures and meeting new people.
